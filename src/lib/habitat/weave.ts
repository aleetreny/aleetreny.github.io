// and that difference is half of all human drama. Plus a written line per pair,

// the instrument and the line is the person.
//
// The graph the twenty-five carried aboard is clustered far past what chance would
// produce, and nothing explains it. Not something withheld from the residents —
// something that does not exist. The measurement lives here, and in weave.test.ts,
// so that editing a bond cannot quietly destroy the fact.
