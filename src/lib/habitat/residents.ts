// The twenty-five.
//
// Authored before the simulation runs, so that what the engine changes about a
// person is measurable against something real. A resident's initial is their
// identity on a grid and in the weave, which is why no two share one and why the
// alphabet stops at Y.
//
// `voice` is not a mood note. One model writing twenty-five journals will converge
// on a single register unless the register is pinned per person, so this is a hard
// constraint on that resident's generated prose.
//
// `boarding` is how each of them came to be aboard. Read together the twenty-five
// do not add up, and they are not going to: about a third are entirely ordinary, a
// third are odd in a way anybody would have rationalised at the time, and a handful
// do not sit down at all. Nothing here resolves it, because nothing anywhere does.
//
// The prose was authored in docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-31-habitat-residents.md,
