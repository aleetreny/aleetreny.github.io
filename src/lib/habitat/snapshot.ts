// What the window is allowed to see.
//
// The renderer never reads world state. It reads a snapshot: a small, flat,
// read-only description of where everybody is and what has just happened. That
// boundary exists so the simulation can move to a scheduler somewhere else without
// the frontend noticing, and so visiting the portfolio stays cheap.
//
// Until an engine exists, `genesisSnapshot` builds day one hundred straight from
// the authored content. It is deterministic — same seed, same habitat — so the
// view can be developed and tested against a fixed world.
