Room renders by 0_mem0ry — https://0-mem0ry.itch.io/ — kept here to be traced
from. They are the artist's own promo images for the packs in
`public/assets/props/`, and they are the reason a habitat room looks like a room
rather than like a shelf of props. **This directory is not copied into `dist/`,
so none of it is served by the site.**

Every scale below was measured, not estimated — see `../measure/README.md`.
**Drawn at** is the integer factor the render was exported at; divide by it to get
native pixels, which is the scale the sprites were drawn for and the scale a trace
works in.

| File | Drawn at | Native | Tiles of 32 | Traced for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `two-berth-cabin.jpg` | 5.34× | ≈ 204 × 205 | 6.4 × 6.4 | **The Cabins.** Already traced, as `../berth.html`. |
| `shelter-bunker-room.png` | 3× | 154 × 218 | 4.8 × 6.8 | **The Infirmary.** A bed, stores racks, a first-aid box, and an alcove partitioned off the main room. |
| `shelter-bunk-and-stores.jpg` | **unknown — not integer** | — | — | **The Hold. STILL NOT TRACEABLE**, now including against the full pack's 16 × 16 cut and its `_Shadow` variants. Its footlocker's green is in `Shelter_Furniture`, so the pack is right — but the trunk is ~85 px wide where the sheet's is 48, which is not an integer ratio at all. Nothing in `public/assets/props/` matches it at ×1..×4: its bunk is ~144 px wide where the sheet's is 54, and matching its wall, its mattress and a footlocker against every sheet tops out at 0.67. The 2× here came from a hand ruler in an early pass and does not hold. |
| `workshop-two-bay.jpg` | 4× | 250 × 228 | 7.8 × 7.1 | **The Workshops.** Pegboard, dressed bench, tool chest, lockers, shutter, floor grate. |
| `workshop-plate-walls-on-dirt.png` | 4× | 179 × 212 | 5.6 × 6.6 | **The rock half of the map.** (It was the Diggings' material for one pass, before their own pack arrived.) A room walled in salvaged corrugated sheet standing on bare dirt. **Traces:** 22 objects at ncc ≥ 0.88, nine at 1.000, all from `workshop.png`; its dirt is `shelter_terrain` tile (1,9) at median error 0; its plate is `workshop.png` (194,273) at 0.919. |
| `workshop-three-rooms.jpg` | 2× | ≈ 600 × 430 | 18.7 × 13.4 | **How to compose.** Three rooms sharing walls in one frame. Cross-pack: it uses props that are in none of our sheets, so it is a composition reference, not a traceable one. |
| `xmas-container-room.jpg` | 4× | 207 × 213 | 6.5 × 6.7 | **Unassigned, and traces** — 23 objects at ncc ≥ 0.90 across six sheets. A corrugated container fitted out to live in: bunk, table laid for one, shelves of tins, a toilet in the corner, a tree. The densest domestic room in the archive and no room in the habitat is its size yet. |
| `shelter-dorm.jpg` | unknown — not integer | — | — | Two made beds and chairs in a shelter. Same problem as `shelter-bunk-and-stores`: the pack is right and the scale is not. |
| `makeshift-two-rooms.png` | 3× | 245 × 181 | 7.7 × 5.7 | **The Diggings — traced 1:1 as Mara's**, 39 objects, 7.8 % differing. against `makeshift.png` + `makeshift_roomtiles.png` — nineteen objects, most at 1.000. It matched *nothing* until that pack arrived, and the band it reported at 1.000 the whole time was a different pack's band of the same shape: NCC scores shape, not colour. Two chambers sharing a partition with a gap in it, a notched outline, a doorway one 32 px tile wide. |
| `makeshift-two-rooms-b.jpg` | 4× | 181 × 187 | 5.7 × 5.8 | **The Diggings.** The shell was solved off this one: band `#c0b8b2`, wall block `makeshift_roomtiles` col 4 rows 7-8 at blockTop y 12, floor col 5 rows 7-8 at median error 6. Rectangle x 4..175, y 4..172, partition at x 71..76, doorway x 74..105. |
| `makeshift-bedsit.jpg` | 4× | 179 × 217 | 5.6 × 6.8 | **The Diggings**, the single-chamber three. Rectangle x 19..158, y 23..194, doorway x 74..105 — the same doorway, in the same place, in all three, which is how we knew they are one template scene dressed three ways. |
| `bathroom-wet-and-filthy.jpg` | 4× (native.py says ×2 — it under-reads this JPEG; reduce by hand with NEAREST) | 184 × 170 | 5.8 × 5.3 | **The Well.** The whole wet vocabulary: puddles, running stains, drains, grating, mop and bucket. |
| `kitchen-working.png` | 4× | 178 × 212 | 5.6 × 6.6 | **The Common**, Pilar's corner only. Griddle, hood, prep tables, under-shelves. |
| `office-ruin.png` | 3× | 236 × 269 | 7.4 × 8.4 | **The Breach.** Broken walls with exposed rebar, concrete rubble, a safe left standing. |
| `office-abandoned.jpg` | 4× | 199 × 199 | 6.2 × 6.2 | **The Bridge.** Desks that read as consoles, a chair, paper over the floor, a cracked window. |
| `office-rock-through-the-floor.png` | native promo art | 545 × 736 | — | **The Breach, the Landing.** Rock pushing up through a built floor. Redrawn promo art: its props do not match the shipped sheets at any integer scale, so trace the *idea*, not the pixels. |
| `shelter-dugout-mouth.png` | 3× | 310 × 215 | 9.7 × 6.7 | **The Dock, the Face.** A dugout entrance with a corrugated hood, spoil heaps, worn tracks. |
| `shelter-hillside-mouth.jpg` | 3× | 237 × 258 | 7.4 × 8.1 | **The Face.** A shelter mouth cut into rock. |
| `shelter-ground-hatch.jpg` | 8× | 89 × 109 | 2.8 × 3.4 | **The Dock.** A hatch flush in the ground. |
| `garden-planters.png` | 4× | 177 × 194 | 5.5 × 6.1 | **Hydroponics.** Improvised planters — drums, tyres, buckets, tins — with living plants in them. |

`fig-scale-audit.png` is not a reference. It is the evidence behind the size
decision in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-habitat-references-and-scale.md`:
every canon grid at 32 px per tile, filled with copies of the traced cabin.
Regenerate it with `python3 ../measure/scale_audit.py <berth 1:1 render> fig-scale-audit.png`.

These are the artist's published promo images, kept out of the built site for
that reason. The wider question — that `public/assets/props/` *is* served to every
visitor and should be cut down to an atlas of only the tiles used — is still open.
